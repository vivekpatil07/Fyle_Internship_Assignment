# Github Repositories listing page
This project is a Fyle web development internship task created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. The website contains a textbox in which user can write a username of any github account, the other part contains a list to select a limit to show the number of repositories on the page (default limit is 10) and the maximum limit is 100. Website also contains a button which when clicked shows the list of all the repositories available with that name. In addition, I have added a search bar to filter the repositories.
